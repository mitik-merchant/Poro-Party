# Overview
Our goal with Poro Party is to create a fun, web-based multiplayer game to be played on the web by a desktop/laptop. The theme of our game revolves around players controlling cats in a variety of small sport-based minigames, such as dodgeball, soccer, and volleyball. We used the Phaser 3 HTML framework as the basis for the game, and coupled it with the NodeJS environment so the game can be played across seperate connections.
